### Hi there 👋 I'm Gabriel

## ⭐ About Me
I create the magic behind cinema, explore deep learning applications for visual effects and challenge the limits of 0’s and 1’s.
I'm a Computer Vision Researcher & Engineer with 4+ years of experience building AI-powered solutions for image and video processing. While my roots are in VFX and 3D, my passion lies in coding and pushing the boundaries of what AI can do in visual media.
From training deepfake architectures to integrating models like Stable Diffusion and Robust Video Matting into real-world VFX pipelines, I specialize in turning cutting-edge research into production-ready tools. I’ve led innovations across deep learning workflows, serverless AI pipelines, and computer vision applications — all with Python at the core.
